# Visitor-Entry-System

A web application which can capture the Name, Email, Phone number of the visitor and the same information is captured for the host on front-end. At the back-end, once the user enters the information in the form, the back-end stores all the information with the time stamp of the entry. This triggers an email to the host informing him of the details of the visitor. There is a provision of the checkout time which the visitor can provide once he leaves. This triggers an email to the visitor with the complete form which includes:

  1. Host Name
  2. Visitor Name
  3. Visitor Email
  4. Checkin Time
  5. Purpose




# SENDING EMAIL:
For sending emails the written code uses REST API by EmailJS.
