# Visitor-Entry-System

A web-based application which can capture the Name, Email, Phone number of the visitor and the same information is captured for the host on front-end. At the back-end, once the user enters the information in the form, the back-end stores all the information with the time stamp of the entry. This triggers an email to the host informing him of the details of the visitor. There is a provision of the checkout time which the visitor can provide once he leaves. This triggers an email to the visitor with the complete form which includes:

  1. Name
  2. Phone number
  3. Check-in time
  4. Check-out time
  5. Host name
  6. Host Email
  7. Host Number
